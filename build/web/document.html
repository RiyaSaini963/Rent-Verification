  <h2>Aadhaar Card</h2>
  <p>
 A citizen of India needs an Aadhaar to enjoy certain government welfare facilities provided by the Government of India. The document acts as a proof of address and identity for an individual. Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). Once an individual enrols for the Aadhaar card by visiting Aadhaar Centres or Banks/Post-offices, he/she can download and print UIDAI Aadhaar by using the enrolment ID, virtual ID or Aadhaar number provided by the UIDAI.
